## 2. SCOPE OF LICENSE GRANT

Contributors Copyright Grant. Subject to the terms of this license, including the license conditions and limitations in section 3, 4 and 5, each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free copyright license to reproduce its contribution, prepare derivative works of its contribution, and distribute its contribution or any derivative works that you create together with the licensed libraries.

## 3. PERMITTED MODIFICATIONS

Library Use. The Licensee is permitted to modify existing functionalities of the Looplex Legal Data Libraries for the sole purpose of customizing and enhancing their capabilities to meet specific requirements of new or different use case scenarios in legal services. Such modifications are restricted to the addition of new functionality to an existing object without altering its structure, or to extend its behavior without explicitly modifying it, by means of enhancements to high-level functional behaviors within those libraries.

High-Level Derivations: You can create and distribute your own modules, extensions, or plug-ins that interface with the libraries. These derivatives can be under different licenses, including proprietary ones, provided they interact with the library in a way that doesn't necessitate modifying the library itself.

## 4. RESTRICTIONS ON MODIFICATIONS

No architectural or structural changes. The Licensee is expressly prohibited from making any modifications, alterations, or enhancements to the core structure, architecture, or operational mechanisms of the Looplex Legal Data Libraries. All functional enhancements, extensions, derivations or modifications made by the Licensee must be implemented in a manner that 'wraps around' the existing library functions, without altering the current API structure, dependency fetching and signature behavior of the libraries in the Looplex Platform.

No Modification of the Library: You can't change the internal code of the licensed libraries. If you do modify it, the modifications must also be released as open source under these licensing terms. This ensures that the library's core functionalities remain open and available to the public in the Looplex Platform.

Platform Limitation - The license granted in the Agreement extends only to the software or derivative works that you create that run directly on Looplex Platform could services, on any Looplex run-time technology (such as the Looplex Code or Looplex Lawtex® Assembler v.1.0 or higher), or any other licensed instance of the Looplex Platform, either on-premises or in the cloud.

## 5. REDISTRIBUTION AND SHARING

Redistribution of Modified or Derived Functions: You may redistribute functions and software that have been modified or derived from the Looplex Open Data Libraries, provided that such redistribution is under the same terms and conditions as this license.

Open Source Requirement: Any modified or derived functions that are redistributed must be made available as open source under the same licensing terms as stipulated herein.

Use in Proprietary Software: The Licensee may incorporate the derivative works into their proprietary solutions in the Looplex Platform; however, such incorporation does not exempt the Licensee from the obligation to release these derivative works under the same copyleft terms. The derivative works, when released or distributed, must be done so under a license that allows use, modification, and distribution by others in the Looplex Platform, under the same terms as this license.

## 6. ENHANCED LICENSING REQUIREMENTS

Thresholds for this license. There are specific thresholds concerning user engagement and revenue generation by the Licensee and its affiliates, which, when surpassed, trigger additional licensing requirements:

(a) User Engagement Threshold: If, at any point during the term of this license, the total number of licensed users or monthly active users (MAUs) for all products or services offered by or on behalf of the Licensee exceeds 5,000 MAUs; and/or

(b) Revenue Generation Threshold: if the Licensee reports an annualized gross income exceeding BRL 6 million in the past calendar month, calculated as an average monthly revenue of BRL 500,000 or more.

Aggregated Thresholds for a group. The revenue and monthly active user thresholds for the purposes of this license shall aggregate the totals from the Licensee and all its Affiliates, if you are a legal entity, as well as any group of individuals organized in a common venture if you are an individual.

Mandatory Enhanced License Request. Upon reaching either of the thresholds set forth in this Section 6, the Licensee is required to promptly request an enhanced license from Looplex. The granting of such an enhanced license is subject to the sole discretion of Looplex.

Conditional Exercise of Rights. The Licensee is not authorized to exercise any rights granted under this Agreement if either of the aforementioned thresholds is surpassed, unless and until Looplex expressly grants the enhanced license.

Continued Monitoring and Compliance. The Licensee agrees to continuously monitor its user engagement and revenue generation to determine if the thresholds outlined in this section are met or exceeded. Compliance with these conditions is mandatory for the continued validity of the license. Non-compliance may lead to license revocation without prior notice and potential legal action for breach of contract and intellectual property infringement, as well as any court provisional measures necessary to cease this intellectual property infringement.
